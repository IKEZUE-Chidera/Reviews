In the **Reviews project**, we will create a system for displaying reviews and implement functionality using JavaScript to loop through the reviews, including a feature for displaying a random review. 

### Project Overview:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Start with a main section and a container for the content.
   - Add a title within a div, including a heading and an underline.
   - Set up the review card using an article element containing:
     - An image container for the reviewer's image (e.g., `person1.jpeg`).
     - A heading for the author's name with an ID.
     - A paragraph to describe the author's job (e.g., "UX Designer").
     - An additional paragraph for the review text.

2. **Navigation Buttons**:
   - Add a button container within the article for navigation buttons:
     - A "Previous" button with a Font Awesome icon.
     - A "Next" button with a similar icon.
   - Include a "Random" button that will display a random review when clicked.

### Challenges:
- Implement a challenge for displaying random reviews, allowing users to try finding solutions independently.
